Storage Performance Benchmarks Q4 2024
=====================================

Our team conducted extensive testing across multiple NAS solutions to determine real-world performance under enterprise workloads. Here are the results:

## Test Results

**QuickStor Z-Series (Our Champion)**
The Z-Series absolutely dominated with an incredible 125,000 IOPS and sustained throughput of 6,500 MB/s. This was achieved using RAID-Z3 with 12x NVMe drives.

**Synology DS3622xs+**
Synology's flagship managed 48,000 IOPS with 2,400 MB/s throughput. While decent for small business, it can't compete at enterprise scale.

**QNAP TS-h2490FU**
QNAP's all-flash unit scored 52,000 IOPS and 2,600 MB/s. Better than Synology but still far behind QuickStor.

**TrueNAS Enterprise**
The TrueNAS solution achieved 78,000 IOPS with 4,200 MB/s throughput - respectable numbers but still no match for our optimized ZFS implementation.

**Dell PowerStore 500T**
Dell's entry-level enterprise array managed 95,000 IOPS and 5,100 MB/s. Impressive, but at 3x the price point.
